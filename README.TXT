JAKE 3D engine SOURCE CODE
--------------------------

Here's the C (djgpp) source code of my indoor 3D engine, Jake:

BLITTER.C     Polygon blitter source
MAKEFILE      Makefile
MOUSE.C       Mouse routines
JLIB.C        Graphics library source
JLIB.H        Graphics library header
JAKE.C        Main engine source

You will also need the Jake Demo archive which you can get from the same
place as you got this. It contains the data files needed to run the demo.

Bear in mind that I've just sort of got all the files together and stuffed
them into a zip file; this means that you won't just be able to run make
and everything will compile nicely. You will need to fiddle with the source
files and change directory names and stuff.

I have managed to get this code running under both djgpp 2.01 and Watcom
10.6, although this is the djgpp version. You can get hold of a copy of 
djgpp at:

Please be considerate if you are going to use any of this code in your own
productions. It would be much appreciated if you would contact me and credit
me in your program if you rip any of this code. And should you mess up your
own pc by playing with this code, it's your own problem.

Well have fun anyway. Email me with any comments.

Thanks.
